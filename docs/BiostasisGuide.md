# Biostasis Technology

## Overview
This module integrates biostasis technology, allowing simulations, monitoring, and reporting on biological preservation techniques.

### Features
1. **Simulation**:
   - Simulate biostasis processes like cryopreservation and suspended animation.
2. **Monitoring**:
   - Track vital parameters during biostasis simulations.
3. **Reporting**:
   - Generate detailed reports on outcomes and performance.

### Usage
1. Access the Biostasis Dashboard to monitor simulations.
2. Use the Biostasis Control interface to configure and start simulations.
3. View real-time data and download reports from the dashboard.

Refer to the main README.md for setup and installation.
