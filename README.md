# Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES) Project

## Overview
The Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES) framework is a comprehensive platform designed for real-time signal monitoring, analysis, and interpretation using advanced fluctuation-based techniques. This project integrates cutting-edge IoT, machine learning, and signal processing technologies.

## Key Features
1. **Real-Time Signal Processing**
   - Efficient data ingestion using Kafka and RabbitMQ.
   - High-performance AI engine leveraging OpenCV, ONNX, and NVIDIA Triton.
   - Secure, low-latency communication with gRPC and Protobuf.

2. **Advanced Storage Solutions**
   - Time-series storage with InfluxDB.
   - Immutable and archival storage with immudb and IPFS.

3. **Security and Compliance**
   - Zero Trust architecture powered by Cloudflare Zero Trust.
   - Quantum-safe encryption (QKD + PQC) for future-proof security.
   - Fully compliant with ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, and DARPA standards.

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Edge compute using Cloudflare Workers.
   - Accelerated data access with Redis caching.

5. **User-Centric Features**
   - Centralized monitoring dashboards with Grafana.
   - Open-source SDKs for easy integration.
