# Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES) Platform

A cutting-edge cyber warfare and threat detection system leveraging advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques for real-time anomaly detection and threat analysis.

## Overview

The FES platform provides military and security agencies with comprehensive cyber intelligence capabilities through:
- Real-time anomaly detection using fluctuation-enhanced sensing
- Advanced signal correlation for threat attribution
- Machine learning-powered predictive analytics
- Dynamic threat visualization and mapping
- Secure IoT sensor integration

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Advanced Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes fluctuation-enhanced techniques to detect subtle irregularities in network traffic and system behavior
- **Real-time Threat Analysis**: Processes and analyzes signals in real-time from distributed IoT sensors
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Employs sophisticated ML models for pattern recognition and threat prediction
- **Command Center Interface**: Military-grade dark mode UI optimized for 24/7 operations
- **Global Threat Mapping**: Interactive visualization of threat origins and progression

### Security Features
- Role-based access control with secure authentication
- End-to-end encryption for all data transmissions
- Real-time monitoring of system integrity
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript
- D3.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- WebSocket for real-time updates

### Backend
- Node.js Express server for API gateway
- Python Flask for signal processing
- PostgreSQL for data persistence
- WebSocket server for real-time communication

### Signal Processing
- NumPy and SciPy for advanced signal analysis
- Custom fluctuation-enhanced sensing algorithms
- Wavelet transform for multi-scale analysis
- FFT for frequency domain analysis

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd fes-platform
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# Database configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[dbname]

# Server configuration
PORT=5000
PYTHON_SERVICE_PORT=5001
```

4. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### Authentication
```typescript
// Login to the platform
const { login } = useUser();
await login({ username, password });
```

### Signal Processing
```typescript
// Process signal data
const { processSignal } = useSignalProcessing();
const result = await processSignal({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  source: "network_sensor_001",
  data: [/* signal data */]
});
```

### Threat Monitoring
```typescript
// Subscribe to real-time threats
const { threats } = useThreats();
// Threats will update automatically via WebSocket
```

## Security Considerations

- All authentication endpoints use secure session management
- Signal data is validated before processing
- Database queries are protected against SQL injection
- WebSocket connections require authentication
- Regular security audits recommended
