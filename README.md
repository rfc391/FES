# Fluctuation-Enhanced Sensing (FES) Application

## Description
The FES Application is a real-time signal analysis and monitoring tool. It integrates advanced signal processing techniques with a live dashboard for visualization and interaction. Designed for applications in diagnostics, molecular analysis, and real-time monitoring.

## Features
- Preprocess signals (remove noise, normalize data).
- Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD) using advanced algorithms.
- Live dashboard with real-time visualization of signals.
- Modular and scalable design for integration with IoT sensors.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd FES-main
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
1. **Signal Preprocessing**: Automatically cleans and normalizes input signals.
2. **Live Dashboard**: Access the dashboard for real-time signal visualization. It launches automatically when the application runs.
